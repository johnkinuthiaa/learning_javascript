//When a comparison happens, the result of the comparison is just a boolean value, it's either true or false.

/*Take the following two examples:

const isBigger = 5 > 4

const isBigger = true

In both of the above cases, we're creating a Boolean variable called isBigger with a value of true.

Since 5 is greater than 4, isBigger is assigned the value of true once the 5 > 4 expression is evaluated */
